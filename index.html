      If we had to tell you one thing about us... it would be that we're so thankful. Thankful that God brought us together. We're so excited to be getting married and most of all excited to share our lives with one another. Great things really started happening in our lives when backgrounds and talents brought us together to work on the same team at AOL. Jeremy was a product director, leading a team on AIM, while Ashley was a designer. One day we were assigned to take the train up to NYC to work a booth for internet week. As soon as we sat next to each other on the train, there was an instant connection (internet pun intended). It sounds cliche to say, but from the very first time we spoke, we could both tell that there was something special between us.
    </p>
    <p class="p-two">
      We continued to work on the same team for a handful of months, during which time we became close friends. It was inevitable; we couldn't stay friends for very long — we started dating at the beginning of 2011 and have been having a blast together ever since! Together, we bring out each others' best parts and inspire each other creatively, spiritually, and intellectually. We are truly blessed. We look forward to creating a lifetime of memories together, especially with you — our family and friends!
